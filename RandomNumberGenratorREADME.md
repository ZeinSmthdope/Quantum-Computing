Random Number Generator Circuit
From 5 qubits, we can generate 32 states. By using a H gate on each qubit, a superposition of equal probability between every possible state is created. 
This produces the ideal scenario to create a random number generator from state 0 to state 31. 
Since the circuit will pick one state randomly with equal probability, this can generate a random number assigned to each state using classical registers with quantum registers.
